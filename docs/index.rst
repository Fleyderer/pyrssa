==================================

Methods and tools for Singular Spectrum Analysis in Python including decomposition,
forecasting and gap-filling for univariate and multivariate time series.
General description of the methods with many examples can be found in the book
Golyandina (2018, <doi:10.1007/978-3-662-57380-8>).

Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA, in short) is a modern non-parametric method for the analysis
of time series and digital images. This package provides a set of fast and reliable implementations
of various routines to perform decomposition, reconstruction and forecasting. A comprehensive
description of the methods and functions from Rssa can be found in Golyandina et al (2018). The
companion web-site is https://ssa-with-r-book.github.io/.
